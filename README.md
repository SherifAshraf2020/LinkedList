# Linked List Implementations in C++

## Overview

This repository contains various implementations of linked list data structures in C++ using templates. Each implementation includes both the header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files, providing a comprehensive understanding of different linked list types.

## Linked List Types

- **Singly Linked List**: A basic linked list where each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
- **Header-Trailer Linked List**: A doubly linked list with dummy header and trailer nodes to simplify edge case handling.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `LinkedList/`: Contains the main linked list implementation files.
- `arrayListType/`: Includes array-based list implementation files.
- `circularLinkedList/`: Contains circular linked list implementation files.
- `doublyLinkedList/`: Includes doubly linked list implementation files.
- `headerTrailerLinkedList/`: Contains header-trailer linked list implementation files.

## Getting Started

To explore and use these linked list implementations:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SherifAshraf2020/LinkedList.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd LinkedList
   ```
3. **Compile the Code**:
   Use a C++ compiler to compile the `.cpp` files. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o linkedlist main.cpp
   ```
4. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./linkedlist
   ```

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- Basic understanding of linked list data structures and templates in C++.
